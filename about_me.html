            Hi classmate, My name is Sunday Ekhasomi, I'm currently majoring in CS with a minor in CIT. I served my mission 5 years ago and I loved it.
            I love playing football, what some of our friends in the west call soccer. I which BYU-Idaho can be moved to a different state that is 
            a little warm and cozy, but it's just a wish. I love BYUI and I'm glad to be part of it. Somethings I also love doing is cooking and hanging out 
            with friends. I'm excited for this class, I'm sure it's going to be a good experience for us all, I'm excited to get to meet everyone.
